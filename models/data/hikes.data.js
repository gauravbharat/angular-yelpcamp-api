Surefootedness, a head for hights and a good fitness level are essential requirements for tours of up to 7 hours daily walking time. Trekking experience is prerequisite for self-guided individual tours. A good quality equipment is vital, since in parts there is no luggage transfer with overnight stays in chalets or cabins, so backpacks need to be carried by each individual.',
